This Project aims at predicting movies based on 2 systems:

Demographic Filtering:This provides generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and/or genre.
The System recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features.

Content Based Filtering: This suggest similar items based on a particular item. 
This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations.
The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.

The dataframes are created from the datasets in csv format in the rar file. then the 2 dataframes are merged on the id column.

In content based filtering, we rate the movies based on the following metric taken from the Imdb Website:
